# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based interactive sorting visualizer that showcases popular sorting algorithms in action. This project provides a step-by-step visualization of how different sorting algorithms operate, making it a helpful tool for learning and understanding sorting concepts.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, pause, or reset the visualization.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the animation speed to watch the sorting process at your preferred pace.
- **Array Size Adjustment**: Change the number of elements in the array to see how algorithms handle different data sizes.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: View each algorithm's operations in real-time, allowing for a clear understanding of how data is sorted.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for sorting algorithms and animation.
